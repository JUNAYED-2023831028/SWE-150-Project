TurboMaze is a fast-paced maze adventure game where the green-colored player navigates through a complex network of paths to collect all the yellow balls (points/collectibles) and safely exit the maze. Each cell in the maze is defined as either a wall or a path, so the player must choose the correct route to reach all the balls.  Along the way, there are smart enemies (red ghosts/enemies) that use shortest pathfinding (BFS) to locate and chase the player. If the player comes into contact with a red enemy, it’s GAME OVER.  If the player collects all the yellow balls → YOU WIN. The main objective is to increase the score, navigate quickly, avoid red enemies, and use strategic thinking to successfully complete the maze.
